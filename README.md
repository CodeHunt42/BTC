Binary Tag Compound - A C++ include-only serialization library

The BTC library provides a simple way to serialize arbitrarily 
complicated data in binary form.
It defines the so-called BTagCompound object which is designed to 
work as a hashlist that stores string objects (the keys) together with 
data of primitive or BTagCompound type (the value).
In this way it is able to map even the most complicated structure.
